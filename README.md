# hello-world
this is me testing myself to see how well I can use github.com


Hello guys this is my first time using github fully. I am learning how to navigate github so that I can become the best developer possible. I really hope by the end of my learning I have changed the world by helping those who need help & changing hardened hearts. God is Love!
